                <h2>Half Marathon COURSE</h2>
                
                <p>Half-Marathon (13.1-miles): Half-Marathon event starts and finishes in the Athletes
                    Village to the cheers of the enthusiastic crowd. Once finished, runners can enjoy 
                    the finish line festivities, including the Sports &#38; Fitness Expo and live entertainment. 
                    Post-race refreshments will be provided and the Awards Ceremony for the Half-Marathon 
                    will begin once the results have been certified</p>
                
                 <h2>10k COURSE</h2> 
                
                <p>The 10K event starts and finishes in the Athletes Village. The paths are approximately 
                    6 ft wide, perfectly paved and wind around through the forest. Each course has only 
                    two small hills with a minimal elevation gain to navigate and a fast downhill to flat 
                    finish to the roaring cheers of the crowd.</p>
                
                <h2>Sprint</h2>

                <p>Course will offer a 1-loop 1/2 mile swim, the exact same 28 mile Bike Course 
                    as the Olympic distance and a 5km run.</p>

                <h2>Try-A-Tri</h2>
                
                <p>This novice race is designed for the first time triathlete, those new to the 
                    sport, and our Junior Triathletes. The swim is a shorter, more manageable 1/4 mile 
                    distance, (instead of the standard 1/2-mile Sprint distance swim), 10 mile bike 
                    ride (vs 12 miles and it's a 2 loop course making it very spectator friendly!) 
                    and a flat 2 mile run (vs 3 mile sprint course).</p>

                <h2>Splash and Dash</h2> 
                
                <p>The Splash and Dash consists of a 100 meter swim and a 50 yard dash for athletes under 10.</p>
